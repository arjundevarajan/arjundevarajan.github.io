<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html"><strong>Toucan AI</strong></a> is what an outsider might call my first <strong>real</strong> startup. Itâ€™s the first one that received any kind of notable publicity, and itâ€™s the first one for which we scrounged together the marketing efforts that help a company appear â€œlegitâ€ in the eyes of strangers and online followers.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this started with the advent of our <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog"><strong>company blog</strong></a>. While we werenâ€™t writing new blogposts every single day, we made it happen on a fairly regular schedule, at least throughout much of late 2019 and early 2020, with only a team of 4 writing/editing contributors!</p>

<p>Personally, <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/our-remote-team/"><strong>this</strong></a> is probably still my favorite of our blogposts, though <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/black-lives-matter/"><strong>this</strong></a> is undisputedly the most <em>important</em>, and <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/100-customers/"><strong>this</strong></a> probably marks the most notable for our companyâ€™s trajectory.</p>

<p>Quick sidenoteâ€”if youâ€™d bought Shopify stock when we published <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/the-shopify-revolution/"><strong>this article</strong></a> (when Shopify had already been growing like crazy, and long before anyone knew about the impending pandemic), itâ€™d be worth at least 4x that amount now.</p>
