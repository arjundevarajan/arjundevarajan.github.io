<p>I’ve always been interested in startups, but as I’ve gotten more entrenched in them over time, I’ve discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/Arjun_Headshot.jpg" alt="Me" /></p>

<p>Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a system of late-stage capitalism that encourages the rapid growth of companies at the explicit expense of workers’ rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is norm in the US in 2021, I believe there’s a better way of working within it (at least until it’s possible to dismantle it entirely).</p>

<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html">My last startup experience</a> especially provided me with a new frame of reference on what kind of company and workplace I’m interested in running in the future, and what version of employership I plan to offer (next time I’m someone’s employer).</p>
