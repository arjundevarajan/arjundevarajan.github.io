<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nebulalearning">Nebula Learning</a> was an educational web platform that used coding concepts to help teach middle school curriculum math.</p>

<h2 id="origins">The Origins</h2>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who would later be my co-founder at <a href="./toucan-ai">Toucan AI</a>) and I started this company with a few of our classmates while in undergrad at Duke. We had gotten close during our summer jointly interning for <a href="./farmshots">Farmshots</a>, and he was really excited about working on an edtech (educational technology) startup that taught coding concepts.</p>

<p>After we both got our first real dose of a legitimately functional, revenue-producing startup like Farmshots, we had an idea for how we wanted to go about taking Nebula seriously. We set Saturday workdays, in which weâ€™d go to the local coworking space in downtown Durham, NC, (called the <a href="https://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a>), and sit and work on our startup all day long.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>As junior and senior year of college progressed, we got increasingly serious about Nebula, and much of our college coursework fell to the wayside.</p>

<p>We ended up applying to and getting into <a href="https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu/melissa-doug/">Melissa &amp; Doug Entrepreneurs</a>, Dukeâ€™s flagship student entrepreneurship program.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A bit of background here: <a href="https://www.melissaanddoug.com/">Melissa &amp; Doug</a> is a huge childrenâ€™s toy designer and manufacturer in the USâ€”-chances are, if you have a kid in the US, theyâ€™ve likely seen, played with, or own an M&amp;D product of some sort (maybe a wooden puzzle or a stuffed animal).</p>

  <p>Melissa and Doug Bernstein, the founders of M&amp;D, started the M&amp;D Entrepreneurs program at Duke (Melissa is a Duke alum) as a way of providing student founders with funding (without taking equity) so they could work on their startups instead of doing an internship over the summer.</p>

  <p>The point of the program is to provide guidance and mentorship to students as theyâ€™re building their startups (from people who have founded companies themselves), as well as connections to investors and relevant people and a Demo Day at Melissa &amp; Dougâ€™s house at the end of the program, during which you pitch to a group of investors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The summer between junior and senior year, through the M&amp;D Entrepreneurs program, Vishnu and I (and a few of our classmates) built out the web platform and got together a group of interested teachers and schools to pilot out the program.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we ended up piloting it in 7 schools (public, private, and charter) with over 500 students throughout, both as summer and in-year programs! We had <a href="../reviews#nebulaReviews">a lot of excitement from teachers and students</a> (and even some commitment from investors at the M&amp;D Demo Day), but ultimately, we found that the money from schools just wasnâ€™t there to help fund what we were looking to build.</p>

<p>Regardless, it formed the foundation for my startup-founding working relationship with Vishnu, and it helped us envision what it would be like (from a commitment perspective, especially) for us to start something once we graduated from college.</p>
