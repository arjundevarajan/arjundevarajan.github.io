<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html">Toucan AI</a> is what an outsider might call my first <em>real</em> startup. It’s the first one that received any kind of notable publicity, and it’s the first one for which we scrounged together the marketing efforts that help a company appear “legit” in the eyes of strangers and online followers.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this started with the advent of our <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog">company blog</a>. While we weren’t writing new blogposts <em>every day</em>, we made it happen on a fairly regular schedule, at least throughout much of late 2019 and early 2020, with only a team of 4 writing/editing contributors!</p>

<p>Personally, <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/our-remote-team/">this</a> is probably still my favorite of our blogposts, though <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/black-lives-matter/">this</a> is undisputedly the most <em>important</em>, and <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/100-customers/">this</a> probably marks the most notable for our company’s trajectory.</p>

<p>Quick sidenote—–if you’d bought Shopify stock when we published <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/the-shopify-revolution/">this article</a> (when Shopify had already been growing like crazy, and long before anyone knew about the impending pandemic), it’d be worth at least 4x that amount now.</p>
