<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html">Toucan AI</a> is what an outsider might call my first <em>real</em> startup. It’s the first one that received any kind of notable publicity, and it’s the first one where we scrounged together the marketing efforts to appear “legit” in the eyes of strangers and online followers.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this started with the advent of our <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog">company blog</a>. While we weren’t writing new blogposts <em>every day</em>, we made it happen on a fairly regular schedule, at least throughout much of late 2019 and early 2020, with only a team of 4 writing/editing contributors!</p>
