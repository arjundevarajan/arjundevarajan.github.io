<p>Iâ€™ve always been interested in startups, but as Iâ€™ve gotten more involved with them over time, Iâ€™ve discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.</p>

<p>Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a late-stage capitalist society that encourages the rapid growth of businesses at the explicit expense of peoplesâ€™ rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is how society in the US operates in 2021, I believe one of the most effective ways to dismantle this incredibly unbalanced power dynamic is by being an employer that treats their co-workers ethically.</p>
