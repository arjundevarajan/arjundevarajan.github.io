<p>I’ve always been interested in startups, but as I’ve gotten more entrenched in them over time, I’ve discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.</p>

<p>Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a system of late-stage capitalism that encourages the rapid growth of companies at the explicit expense of workers’ rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is norm in the US in 2021, I believe there’s a better way of working within it (at least until it’s possible to dismantle it entirely).</p>
