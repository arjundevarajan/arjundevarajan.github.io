      <td style="text-align: left">Full healthcare benefits (covering 100% of physical health, vision, dental, and mental health)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The US <strong>sorely</strong> needs and can easily afford free, universal healthcare</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Unlimited PTO (paid time off) + mandatory minimum time taken off</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Unlimited PTO is fairly common for tech startups these days, but because of our society‚Äôs workaholic mentality, people rarely take that time off. Encouraging a minimum amount taken off (2 weeks a year?) would be benficial for everyone</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Family leave (and pet leave?)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Paid_Family_Leave_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia</a>, ‚ÄúThe United States, Suriname, Papua New Guinea, and a few island countries in the Pacific Ocean are the only countries in the United Nations that do not require employers to provide paid time off for new parents.‚Äù <strong>Sigh</strong> (note: this should include parental, adoption, foster care, surrogacy, etc.)</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">1 hour/week during the workweek for dedicated mental health time (encouraged for therapy)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Every single person on the planet would benefit from seeing a regular, competent (, free) therapist. If mental health is universally covered, we should be encouraging everyone to take advantage of it</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Public transportation covered</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Engaging and exciting work</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">This is great for people who find fulfillment out of their work, but not completely mandatory IMO, since there are a lot of people who see work as a means to an end for their lifestyles, and that‚Äôs a perfectly acceptable way of living. But giving people exciting work to do, if they want it, is a good thing</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Recommended</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Location-flexible and remote-first</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">This should be fairly self-explanatory for people in a post-pandemic world, but now that we have the tools to sustain remote work, it‚Äôs something that everyone can and should be taking advantage of</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Recommended</td>

      <td style="text-align: left">Democratically elected leadership (or some type of enforced ‚Äúdownward accountability‚Äù)</td>
