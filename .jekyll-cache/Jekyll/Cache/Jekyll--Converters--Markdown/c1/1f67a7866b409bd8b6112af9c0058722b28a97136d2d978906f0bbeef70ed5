<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html"><strong>Toucan AI</strong></a> is what an outsider might call my first <strong>real</strong> startup. It’s the first one that received any kind of notable publicity, and it’s the first one for which we scrounged together the marketing efforts that help a company appear “legit” in the eyes of strangers and online followers.</p>

<p>First and foremost, this started with the advent of our <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog"><strong>company blog</strong></a>. While we weren’t writing new blogposts every single day, we made it happen on a fairly regular schedule, at least throughout much of late 2019 and early 2020, with only a team of 4 writing/editing contributors!</p>

<p>Personally, <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/our-remote-team/"><strong>this</strong></a> is probably still my favorite of our blogposts, though <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/black-lives-matter/"><strong>this</strong></a> is undisputedly the most <em>important</em>, and <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/100-customers/"><strong>this</strong></a> probably marks the most notable for our company’s trajectory.</p>

<p>Quick sidenote—if you’d bought Shopify stock when we published <a href="https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/the-shopify-revolution/"><strong>this article</strong></a> (when Shopify had already been growing like crazy, and long before anyone knew about the impending pandemic), it’d be worth at least 4x that amount now.</p>

<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/my-first-sale/id1494151521"><strong>My First Sale</strong></a> is/was a podcast in which I interviewed small e-commerce business owners and tried to paint an honest and authentic picture about their successes and struggles. Many of the interviewees were early Toucan customers and advocates, and many of them are people I now consider to be friends.</p>
