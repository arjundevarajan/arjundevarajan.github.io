I"¨<h1 id="what-is-toucan">What is Toucan?</h1>

<p>Put short, <a href="https://www.toucanai.com">Toucan AI</a> is an AI sales bot for e-commerce stores that can be set up nearly instantly. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who I met while in undergrad at <a href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke</a>) and I co-founded the company right out of college and spent nearly 3 years trying to build something special in the conversational AI space.</p>

<p>Ultimately, even though the final outcome wasnâ€™t <em>exactly</em> what weâ€™d envisioned, we learned more throughout the process than we ever couldâ€™ve imagined, going through nearly every piece of the stereotypical startup journey there is (fundraising, hiring, product development, sales, marketing, firing, and acquisitions, to name a few).</p>
