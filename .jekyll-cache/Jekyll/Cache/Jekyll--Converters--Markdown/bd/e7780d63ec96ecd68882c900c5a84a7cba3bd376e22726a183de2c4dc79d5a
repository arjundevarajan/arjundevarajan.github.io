<p>I’ve always been interested in startups, but as I’ve gotten more involved with them over time, I’ve discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.</p>

<p>Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a late-stage capitalist society that encourages the rapid growth of businesses at the explicit expense of peoples’ rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is how society in the US operates in 2021, I believe one of the most effective ways to dismantle this incredibly unbalanced power dynamic is by being an employer that treats their co-workers ethically.</p>
