<h2 id="the-origins">The Origins</h2>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who would later be my co-founder at <a href="./toucan-ai">Toucan AI</a>) and I started this company with a few of our classmates while in undergrad at Duke. We had gotten close during our summer jointly interning for <a href="./farmshots">Farmshots</a>, and he was really excited about working on an edtech (educational technology) startup that taught coding concepts.</p>

<p>After we both got our first real dose of a legitimately functional, revenue-producing startup like Farmshots, we had an idea for how we wanted to go about taking Nebula seriously. We set Saturday workdays, in which weâ€™d go to the local coworking space in downtown Durham, NC, (called the <a href="https://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a>)</p>
