<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who I met while in undergrad at <a href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke</a>) and I co-founded the company right out of college and spent nearly 3 years trying to build something special in the conversational AI space.</p>

<p>Ultimately, even though the final outcome wasn‚Äôt <em>exactly</em> what we‚Äôd envisioned, we learned more throughout the process than we ever could‚Äôve imagined, going through nearly every piece of the stereotypical startup journey there is (fundraising, hiring, product development, sales, marketing, firing, and acquisitions, to name a few).</p>

<p>Ultimately, there were countless lessons I learned from my experiences with Toucan, but describing those in detail would not result in an appropriately concise and readable singular webpage, but a few things do stand out.</p>
