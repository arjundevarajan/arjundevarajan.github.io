<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nebulalearning">Nebula Learning</a> was an educational web platform that used coding concepts to help teach middle school curriculum math.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins">The Origins</h2>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who would later be my co-founder at <a href="./toucan-ai">Toucan AI</a>) and I started this company with a few of our classmates while in undergrad at Duke. We had gotten close during our summer jointly interning for <a href="./farmshots">Farmshots</a>, and he was really excited about working on an edtech (educational technology) startup that taught coding concepts.</p>

<p>After we both got our first real dose of a legitimately functional, revenue-producing startup like Farmshots, we had an idea for how we wanted to go about taking Nebula seriously. We set Saturday workdays, in which we’d go to the local coworking space in downtown Durham, NC, (called the <a href="https://americanunderground.com/">American Underground</a>), and sit and work on our startup all day long.</p>

<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<p>As junior and senior year of college progressed, we got increasingly serious about Nebula, and much of our college coursework fell to the wayside.</p>

<p>We ended up applying to and getting into <a href="https://entrepreneurship.duke.edu/melissa-doug/">Melissa &amp; Doug Entrepreneurs</a>, Duke’s flagship student entrepreneurship program.</p>
