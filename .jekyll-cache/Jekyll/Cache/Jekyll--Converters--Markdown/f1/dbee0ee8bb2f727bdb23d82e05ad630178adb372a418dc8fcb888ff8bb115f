<h2 id="my-take">My Take</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve always been interested in startups, but as Iâ€™ve gotten more entrenched in them over time, Iâ€™ve found a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.</p>

<p><img src="./assets/Arjun_Headshot.jpg" alt="Me" /></p>

<p>Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a system of late-stage capitalism that encourages the rapid growth of companies at the explicit expense of workersâ€™ rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is what the US is in 2021, I believe thereâ€™s a better way of working within it.</p>

<p><a href="./startups/toucan-ai.html">My last startup experience</a> especially provided me with a new frame of reference on what kind of company and workplace Iâ€™m interested in running in the future, and what version of employership I plan to offer, next time Iâ€™m someoneâ€™s employer.</p>
