<p>These are the benefits I plan to offer, next time I’m someone’s employer:</p>

      <td style="text-align: left">Full healthcare benefits (covering 100% of physical health, vision, dental, and mental health)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The US <strong>sorely</strong> needs and can easily afford free, universal healthcare</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Unlimited PTO (paid time off) + mandatory minimum time taken off</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Unlimited PTO is fairly common for tech startups these days, but because of our society’s workaholic mentality, people rarely take that time off. Encouraging a minimum amount taken off (2 weeks a year?) would be benficial for everyone</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Family leave (and pet leave?)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Paid_Family_Leave_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia</a>, “The United States, Suriname, Papua New Guinea, and a few island countries in the Pacific Ocean are the only countries in the United Nations that do not require employers to provide paid time off for new parents.” <strong>Sigh</strong> (note: this should include parental, adoption, foster care, surrogacy, etc.)</td>

      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">1 hour/week during the workweek for dedicated mental health time (encouraged for therapy)</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Every single person on the planet would benefit from seeing a regular, competent (, free) therapist. If mental health is universally covered, we should be encouraging everyone to take advantage of it</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Absolute necessity</td>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Public transportation covered</td>

<ul>
  <li>1 hr/week dedicated mental health time (encouraged for therapy)</li>
  <li>location flexible &amp; remote-first</li>
  <li>democratically elected leadership? some kind of “downward” accountability (not just toward shareholders). unions not enough</li>
  <li>engaging and exciting work (though only if the employee wants that—people should be allowed to do work as a means to an end)</li>
</ul>
