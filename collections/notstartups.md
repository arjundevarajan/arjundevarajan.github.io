## Snacks for the Socially Distanced
This has been written about extensively in [other sections of this site](./content#s4tsd), but this podcast is truly my pride and joy. (Vishnu and) I are obsessed with food, and finding an excuse to review grocery store snacks brought us (or at least me) a lot of serotonin over the past year in a time when that was scarce. 

In case you missed this on other pages, we got a **ton** of free snacks from various companies that wanted us to review them, and we even had a (small but) loyal fanbase. 

## Extravagantly Decorated Parties
I'll add to this more in the future, but Vishnu and I have a history of planning and executing on extravagant and (if I say so myself) incredibly impressive parties in our (previously shared) apartment. We even made [a website](https://www.xmas2k19.com/) for this Christmas party for the ages. 

## The Cube {#cube}
[The Cube](https://www.dukethecube.com/) is Duke's entrepreneurship-focused living group. For a very young organization, it's managed to spit out a _ton_ of impressive companies, like [Mati Energy](https://www.drinkmati.com/), [Sprout (previously Smart Metals Recycling)](https://www.sproutup.com/), [Carpe](https://mycarpe.com/), and [Farmshots](http://farmshots.com/). 

I served as its President in 2015 and helped revitalize the group's focus on building startups (rather than working for them or just thinking about them) and helped organize social events. 

## Solar Panel Research

I worked for 2 years under [Kyle Bradbury](https://www.kylebradbury.org/) in Duke's [Energy Data Analytics Lab](https://energy.duke.edu/research/energy-data) to research how to identify solar panels in satellite imagery using remote sensing. 

This work included a [journal article I co-wrote](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016106), now published by *Scientific Data*, a *Nature*-owned journal, as well as a [Kaggle competition](https://github.com/arjundevarajan/herecomesthesun).
