# What is Toucan?

Put short, [Toucan AI](https://www.toucanai.com) is an AI sales bot for e-commerce stores that can be set up nearly instantly.

My friend [Vishnu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/) (who I met while in undergrad at [Duke](https://www.duke.edu)) and I co-founded the company right out of college and spent nearly 3 years trying to build something special in the conversational AI space. 

Ultimately, even though the final outcome wasn't _exactly_ what we'd envisioned, we learned more throughout the process than we ever could've imagined, going through nearly every piece of the stereotypical startup journey there is (fundraising, hiring, product development, sales, marketing, firing, and acquisitions, to name a few).
