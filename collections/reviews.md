While it doesn't have to be the _most_ important consideration when building a new project, having users/customers who really love what you're doing is often a major motivating factor for the people you're working with (coworkers, investors, or otherwise) to keep going. 

There's certainly merit to building things primarily for yourself, but if you have users/customers who are thrilled with your work, it not only can inspire you when you're questioning yourself, but even help convince others to join your cause into the future.
