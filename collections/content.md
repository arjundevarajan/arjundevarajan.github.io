## The Toucan AI Blog
[**Toucan AI**](./startups/toucan-ai.html) is what an outsider might call my first **real** startup. It's the first one that received any kind of notable publicity, and it's the first one for which we scrounged together the marketing efforts that help a company appear "legit" in the eyes of strangers and online followers. 

First and foremost, this started with the advent of our [**company blog**](https://www.toucanai.com/blog). While we weren't writing new blogposts every single day, we made it happen on a fairly regular schedule, at least throughout much of late 2019 and early 2020, with only a team of 4 writing/editing contributors!

Personally, [**this**](https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/our-remote-team/) is probably still my favorite of our blogposts, though [**this**](https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/black-lives-matter/) is undisputedly the most *important*, and [**this**](https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/100-customers/) probably marks the most notable for our company's trajectory. 

Quick sidenoteâ€”if you'd bought Shopify stock when we published [**this article**](https://www.toucanai.com/blog/post/the-shopify-revolution/) (when Shopify had already been growing like crazy, and long before anyone knew about the impending pandemic), it'd be worth at least 4x that amount now.
