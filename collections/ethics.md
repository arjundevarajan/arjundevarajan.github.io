## create a table that lays out the following types of benefits (and maybe a why for each one?)

- competitive salary
- full healthcare benefits (physical health + vision + dental + mental health, all 100% covered)
- 401k matching
- unlimited PTO + mandatory minimum time taken off
- 14 weeks family leave (parental, adoption, foster care, surrogacy, etc.); 2 weeks pet leave
- 1 hr/week dedicated mental health time (encouraged for therapy)
- location flexible & remote-first
- public transportation covered
- democratically elected leadership? some kind of "downward" accountability (not just toward shareholders). unions not enough
- engaging and exciting work (though only if the employee wants thatâ€”people should be allowed to do work as a means to an end)
- inclusivity for all genders, sexes, sexual orientations, races, ethnicities, social classes, abilities, castes, etc. All people
