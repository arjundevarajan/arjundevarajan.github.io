## Toucan AI {#toucan}

[Toucan AI](https://www.toucanai.com) is the e-commerce tech company I spent [the last 3 years of my life](./startups/toucan-ai) building with [Vishnu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/), [Marifel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbarbasa/), and a group of interns, advisors, and investors. While Vishnu and Marifel did the vast majority of the software engineering over the years, I contributed to the development when it made sense, and to the product vision throughout. 

## Shopify How To {#shopifyHowTo}

## Small Box Shops {#smallBoxShops}
