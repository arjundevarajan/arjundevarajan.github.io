I'm Arjun Devarajan, a Duke grad and multiple-time startup founder who's interested in building ethical startups. 

# My Take on Startups {#myTake}

I've always been interested in startups, but as I've gotten more involved with them over time, I've discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely seem to discuss.

Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a late-stage capitalist society that encourages the rapid growth of businesses at the explicit expense of peoples' rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is how society in the US operates in 2021, I believe one of the most effective ways to dismantle this incredibly unbalanced power dynamic is by being an employer who treats their co-workers ethically. 

[**My last startup experience**](./collections/startups/toucan-ai), especially, provided me with a new frame of reference on what kind of company and workplace I'm interested in running in the future, and what version of employership I plan to offer (the next time I'm someone's employer).
