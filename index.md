## My Take on Startups

I've always been interested in startups, but as I've gotten more entrenched in them over time, I've discovered a lot of issues that people in the industry rarely discuss.

Many of these have to do with the inherent flaws of a system of late-stage capitalism that encourages the rapid growth of companies at the explicit expense of workers' rights and livelihoods. That being said, given that this is norm in the US in 2021, I believe there's a better way of working within it (at least until it's possible to dismantle it entirely). 

[My last startup experience](./startups/toucan-ai.html) especially provided me with a new frame of reference on what kind of company and workplace I'm interested in running in the future, and what version of employership I plan to offer (next time I'm someone's employer). 

## My Experiences

First, some background: here's a collection of [startups](./collections/startups.html) I've worked on over the years.

## Other Work

Here are some [ads](./collections/ads.html) I've created to promote various projects.

Here are some [videos](./collections/videos.html) I've writted and edited for fun.

Here are some pieces of [content](./collections/content.html) I've run, at various points, on a recurring basis.

Here are some of the [web projects](./collections/projects.html) I've worked on or helped lead the product vision for.

Here are some of examples of [customers](./collections/reviews.html) who have been really excited about the projects I've worked on.

## My Thoughts

[These](./collections/ethics.html) are some thoughts on what I consider to be necessary in a workplace that truly cares for its employees' well-being and the improvement of society.
