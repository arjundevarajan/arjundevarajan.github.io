		<p>NOTE: This was previously hosted for free at www.volyoo.me, but once the 1-year free trial ended, it was moved to this site.</p>

		<p>Simple. Clean. Useful.</p>

		<p>Volyoome naturally adjusts the volume of your music to accommodate your surroundings and environment. If it detects that you or someone nearby you is talking, the application will decrease your musical volume. Once the person stops talking, the program will gradually bring everything back up to regular levels.</p>

		<p>Note: currently only PC-compatible.</p>

		<p>Download link below and save file to desired location.</p>

		<p>Open compressed folder and "Extract all files".</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vesa0iuy9nigl23/Volyoome.zip?dl=0">Run Volyoome.exe.</a></p>

		<p>Once application says "Volyoome is RUNNING", minimize window and enjoy!</p>
