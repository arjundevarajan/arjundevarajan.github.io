      <h2 id="snacks-for-the-socially-distanced">Snacks for the Socially Distanced</h2>
<p>I’ve written extensively about this in <a href="./content#s4tsd">other sections of this site</a>, but this podcast is truly my pride and joy. (Vishnu and) I are obsessed with food, and finding an excuse to review grocery store snacks brought us (or at least me) a lot of serotonin over the past year in a time when that was scarce.</p>

<p>In case you missed this on other pages, we got a <strong>ton</strong> of free snacks from various companies that wanted us to review them, and we even had a (small but) loyal fanbase.</p>

<h2 id="extravagantly-decorated-parties">Extravagantly Decorated Parties</h2>
<p>I’ll add to this more in the future, but Vishnu and I have a history of planning and executing on extravagant and (if I say so myself) incredibly impressive parties in our (previously shared) apartment. We even made <a href="https://www.xmas2k19.com/">a website</a> for this Christmas party for the ages.</p>

<h2 id="cube">The Cube</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.dukethecube.com/">The Cube</a> is Duke’s entrepreneurship-focused living group. For a very young organization, it’s managed to spit out a <em>ton</em> of impressive companies, like <a href="https://www.drinkmati.com/">Mati Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.sproutup.com/">Sprout (previously Smart Metals Recycling)</a>, <a href="https://mycarpe.com/">Carpe</a>, and <a href="http://farmshots.com/">Farmshots</a>.</p>

<p>I served as its President in 2015 and helped revitalize the group’s focus on building startups (rather than working for them or just thinking about them) and helped organize social events.</p>

<h2 id="solar-panel-research">Solar Panel Research</h2>

<p>I worked for 2 years under <a href="https://www.kylebradbury.org/">Kyle Bradbury</a> in Duke’s <a href="https://energy.duke.edu/research/energy-data">Energy Data Analytics Lab</a> to research how to identify solar panels in satellite imagery using remote sensing.</p>

<p>This work included a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016106">journal article I co-wrote</a>, now published by <em>Scientific Data</em>, a <em>Nature</em>-owned journal, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/arjundevarajan/herecomesthesun">Kaggle competition</a>.</p>
