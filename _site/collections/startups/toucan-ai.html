<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishnu-menon/">Vishnu</a> (who I met while we were undergrads at <a href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke</a>) and I co-founded the company right out of college and spent nearly 3 years trying to build something special in the conversational AI space.</p>

<p>Ultimately, even though the final outcome wasn’t exactly what we’d envisioned, we learned more throughout the process than we ever could’ve imagined, going through nearly every piece of the stereotypical startup journey there is (fundraising, hiring, product development, sales, marketing, firing, and acquisitions, to name a few).</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">The Takeaways</h2>

<p>I’ve learned countless lessons from my experiences with Toucan, far too many to list concisely here, but a couple of them in particular stand out.</p>

<p>Carefully choosing the people you work with is the most important decision you’ll make throughout your entire startup experience. You’ll be asked to weigh in on and make decisions about innumerable aspects of your company’s marketing, sales, product development, management, and moral compass. Having a team you can feel comfortable being open and communicative with will make all the difference as you’re encountering these new challenges.</p>

<p>Also, working on Toucan for several years and then working for <a href="./addshoppers">another startup</a> in the same industry have contributed to my <a href="../ethics">strongly held opinions on workplace and employer ethics</a>. While I’m currently neither my own employer nor anyone else’s, it’s likely that I’ll be in that position again at some point in the future, and when I do, I will be using it to improve the startling imbalance that exists in the world, rather than contributing to it.</p>
